## looking to nom nom logs
I'm looking to nom nom any and all logs.

## how to upload logs
Uploading logs is done via a forked version of Snow's LOA Logs meter.
Having a separate release channel helps with velocity during early development.
Getting it up and running takes about one to two minutes.
Here are the steps:
1. Join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/T5U2JhXDUu) (ramen shop) and react to the
[alpha sign up message](https://discord.com/channels/1174544914139328572/1178348426136670258/1194465615830843392) in the `#alpha-access` channel to receive upload permissions.  \

2. Download and install the [latest version](https://github.com/0fau/loa-logs/releases) of the modified meter.
3. Now we need an access token. Sign into the [website](https://logs.fau.dev/logs). Navigate to settings by clicking on the triple dot
button next to your discord tag on the bottom left.

Generate the token and copy it.
4. Open up the meter and navigate to the **Sync** settings tab.

Enter in your access token and then click **Check** to make sure your access token is valid.
5. Enable Sync (logs.fau.dev).

You're all set now! There are three ways to upload logs.
1. **Auto Upload** (Recommended) \
Enable Auto Upload to automatically upload logs upon raid clear. You can customize which ones
are uploaded.

2. **Bulk Upload** (Recommended) \
Bulk Upload uploads all past logs. It's done via enabling auto upload and then clicking the
**Sync** button next to Sync Past Logs at the very bottom of the settings page.  \
This is usually done once when getting things set up for the first time.

3. **Manual Upload**  \
You can also pick and choose which logs to upload. This is done by clicking on the upload button
on the toolbar in every encounter page.
