# logs.fau.dev

## intro
[logs.fau.dev](https://logs.fau.dev) (black meowket) is a passion project of mine that curates logs of encounters in lost ark.
The initial vision for the site was to have a place where friends could share and review inferno clears,
but it has expanded over time to also encompass other parts of the game. I'm not sure how much of it
will be realized, but it'll be built bit by bit c:

(note: am balancing working on this with a bunch of other time commitments and obligations)
## faq

- **how can I try it out?**  \
Logs are already [publicly available](https://logs.fau.dev/logs) for everyone to search and view!
If you'd like to upload logs of your own, then head over to the [alpha access](/logs/alpha/) page
and follow the instructions there.
- **why do things look like the way they do?**  \
I focus on cloud infra and dist. systems at work. I am a mere dabbler in product design T_T.
If something sticks out to you in an odd way, please share your opinions in the discord server. Feedback is always
appreciated.
- **how can I support the project?**  \
UPLOAD LOGS nom nom and tell friends to :DD  \
